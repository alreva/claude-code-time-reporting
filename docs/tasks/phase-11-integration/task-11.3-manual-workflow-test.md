**User Prompt (Natural Language):**
```
"Log 4 hours of development on INTERNAL for this morning"
```

**Alternative Phrasings:**
- "Track 4 hours of development work on INTERNAL today"
- "I spent 4 hours on INTERNAL development this morning, log it"
- "Create time entry: 4 hours, INTERNAL, development, today"

**Expected Response:**

### Step 2: Midday - Query Today's Entries (12:00 PM)

**Context:** You want to review what you've logged so far today.

**User Prompt:**
```
"Show me my time entries for today"
```

**Alternative Phrasings:**
- "What did I log today?"
- "Query my time entries for today"
- "List all my time entries from today"

**Expected Response:**
```
üìã Time Entries for 2025-10-29:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM time_entries WHERE start_date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Expected:** `1`

---

### Step 3: Afternoon - Correct Morning Entry (1:00 PM)

**Context:** You realize you actually worked 4.5 hours, not 4 hours. Update the entry.

**User Prompt:**
```
"Update entry a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890 to 4.5 hours"
```

**Alternative Phrasings:**

Status: NOT_REPORTED
```

**Verification:**
```bash
/db-psql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM time_entries WHERE start_date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Expected:** `2`

---

### Step 5: Evening - Move Task to Different Project (5:30 PM)

**Context:** You realize the bug fixing work should have been logged under CLIENT-B, not CLIENT-A.

**User Prompt:**
```
"Move entry b2c3d4e5-f6g7-8901-bcde-fg2345678901 to CLIENT-B project, keep the task as bug fixing"
```

**Alternative Phrasings:**

## Common Patterns

### Natural Language Variations

Claude Code understands various phrasings for the same operation:

**Creating Entries:**
- "Log 8 hours of X on Y for Z"
- "Track 8 hours, project Y, task X, date Z"
- "Create time entry: 8h, Y, X, Z"
- "I worked 8 hours on Y doing X today"

**Querying:**
- "Show me entries for today"
- "What did I log this week?"
- "List my time entries for October"
- "Query entries for project INTERNAL"

**Updating:**
- "Update entry <id> to 8 hours"
- "Change entry <id> hours to 8"
- "Fix entry <id>, should be 8 hours"
- "Modify entry <id>: 8 hours"

**Deleting:**
- "Delete entry <id>"
- "Remove entry <id>"
- "Cancel entry <id>"

### Best Practices

1. **Save Entry IDs:** After creating entries, copy the ID for future updates/deletes
2. **Review Before Submitting:** Query today's entries before submitting
3. **Use Natural Language:** Don't worry about exact phrasing - Claude Code understands variations
4. **Verify Important Changes:** Check database after critical updates (moving projects, etc.)
5. **Submit Daily:** Submit entries at end of day for timely approval

## Edge Cases and Errors

### Error: Invalid Project Code

**User Prompt:**
```
"Log 8 hours on INVALID-PROJECT for today"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
‚ùå Failed to create time entry.

Error: Invalid project code "INVALID-PROJECT"

Available projects:
- INTERNAL: Internal Development
- CLIENT-A: Client A Project
- CLIENT-B: Client B Project
```

**Resolution:** Use a valid project code from the list

---

### Error: Invalid Task for Project

**User Prompt:**
```
"Log 8 hours of invalid-task on INTERNAL for today"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
‚ùå Failed to create time entry.

Error: Invalid task "invalid-task" for project INTERNAL

Available tasks for INTERNAL:
- Development
- Bug Fixing
- Code Review
- Documentation
- Meetings
```

**Resolution:** Use a valid task from the project's available tasks

---

### Error: Cannot Update Submitted Entry

**User Prompt:**
```
"Update entry <id-of-submitted-entry> to 10 hours"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
‚ùå Cannot update time entry.

Error: Entry is in SUBMITTED status and cannot be modified.

Status workflow:
- NOT_REPORTED ‚Üí Can edit/delete
- SUBMITTED ‚Üí Read-only (waiting for approval)
- APPROVED ‚Üí Immutable
- DECLINED ‚Üí Can edit and resubmit

This entry must be declined by a manager before you can edit it.
```

---

### Error: Cannot Delete Submitted Entry

**User Prompt:**
```
"Delete entry <id-of-submitted-entry>"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
‚ùå Cannot delete time entry.

Error: Only entries with NOT_REPORTED status can be deleted.
This entry has status: SUBMITTED

To remove this entry, ask a manager to decline it first.
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Responding

**Check MCP Connection:**
```bash
./tests/integration/verify-mcp-connection.sh
```

**Check API Health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

### Authentication Errors

**Verify Token Matches:**
1. Check `.env` file: `BEARER_TOKEN=...`
2. Check Claude Code config: `~/.config/claude-code/config.json`
3. Restart API: `/deploy`
4. Restart Claude Code

### Database State Issues

**Reset Test Data:**
```bash
./tests/e2e/teardown-test-data.sh
./tests/e2e/setup-test-data.sh
```

**Manual Cleanup:**
```bash
/db-psql
DELETE FROM time_entries WHERE user_id = 'test-user';
```

## Next Steps

After completing this workflow:
- Try the **Auto-tracking Workflow** (Task 11.4) for intelligent time suggestions
- Test the **Migration Workflow** (Task 11.5) for moving tasks between projects
- Review **E2E Test Scenarios** (Task 11.2) for comprehensive testing

```

### Step 2: Create Workflow Validation Checklist

Create `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md`:

```markdown
# Manual Workflow Validation Checklist

## Pre-Flight Checks

- [ ] GraphQL API running and healthy
- [ ] Claude Code configured with MCP server
- [ ] Database seeded with test projects
- [ ] Bearer token configured correctly
- [ ] MCP connection verified

## Workflow Execution

### Create Operations
- [ ] Create basic time entry (4 hours, INTERNAL, Development)
- [ ] Create entry with overtime (6.5 + 1.5 hours)
- [ ] Create entry with date range (Monday to Friday)
- [ ] Create entry with tags

### Query Operations
- [ ] Query today's entries
- [ ] Query this week's entries
- [ ] Query by project (INTERNAL)
- [ ] Query by status (NOT_REPORTED)
- [ ] Query single entry by ID

### Update Operations
- [ ] Update hours (4h ‚Üí 4.5h)
- [ ] Update task within same project
- [ ] Update date range
- [ ] Update tags
- [ ] Attempt update on SUBMITTED entry (should fail)

### Move Operations
- [ ] Move entry to different project (CLIENT-A ‚Üí CLIENT-B)
- [ ] Move and change task
- [ ] Move with tag revalidation

### Delete Operations
- [ ] Delete NOT_REPORTED entry
- [ ] Attempt delete SUBMITTED entry (should fail)

### Submit Operations
- [ ] Submit NOT_REPORTED entry
- [ ] Verify status changed to SUBMITTED
- [ ] Attempt submit already-SUBMITTED entry (should be idempotent)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid project code error
- [ ] Invalid task error
- [ ] Invalid tags error
- [ ] Update submitted entry error
- [ ] Delete submitted entry error

## Database Verification

### After Each Operation
- [ ] Entry exists in database
- [ ] Fields match expected values
- [ ] Status is correct
- [ ] Timestamps updated (created_at, updated_at)

### Final State
- [ ] All entries accounted for
- [ ] No orphaned entries
- [ ] Status workflow followed correctly

## Natural Language Variations

- [ ] "Log X hours on Y" works
- [ ] "Track X hours, Y project" works
- [ ] "Create time entry: X, Y, Z" works
- [ ] "Show my entries for today" works
- [ ] "What did I log this week?" works
- [ ] "Update entry <id> to X hours" works
